  * What's an object?
  - Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. 
  That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game 
  basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. 
  In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.
  
  * What is the difference between dot and bracket notation?
  - The mainly difference between dot and bracket notation is that dot you can only use with strings, while brackets you can use with number, quotations, weird characters, expressions.
  
  * How do you property with a key that contains special characters? 
  - You have to use bracket notation
  
  * How do you add a property whose key and value are stored is different variable?
  - You can use a use bracket notation out of the key.
  Example: game["weapons"] = [
  { type: "lasers", location: "lab" }]
  
  * How do we loop through objects to access the value?
  - Using for loops or forEach()
